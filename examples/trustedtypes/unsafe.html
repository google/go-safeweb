    <p>This document installs the following script which introduces a DOM XSS vulnerability:</p>
    <p>
        <code>document.getElementById("hash").innerHTML = location.hash;</code>
    </p>
    With TrustedTypes protection enabled, the browser will reject execution of any JavaScript code on this page.
    You can verify it by looking at the console output)
    <p>location hash: <span id="hash"></span></p>
    <script>
        window.addEventListener('load', function () {
            // This piece of code is vulnerable to DOM XSS.
            document.getElementById("hash").innerHTML = location.hash;
        })
    </script>
