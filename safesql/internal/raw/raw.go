// Package raw is used to provide a bypass mechanism to implement unchecked and legacy conversions packages.
// This package works as a proxy between safesql and any other "conversions" package.
//
// The way it functions is to expect safesql to provide the unexported constructors for TrustedSQLString at init() time.
// Since this package is in internal/ it can only be imported by a parent package, so it is known at compile time that
// these constructors are not unsafely passed around.
package raw

// TrustedSQLString is the constructor for a TrustedSQLString to be used by the unchecked and legacy conversions packages.
// This variable will be assigned by the safesql package at init time.
// The reason why this is an empty interface is to avoid cyclic dependency between safeslq and this package.
var TrustedSQLString interface{}
