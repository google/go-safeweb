// Package legacyconversions provides functions to create values of package safesql types from plain strings.
// Use of these functions could potentially result in instances of safesql types that violate their type contracts, and hence result in security vulnerabilities.
// This package should only be used to gradually migrate to use the safesql package but every use of it should eventually be removed as it represents a security risk.
